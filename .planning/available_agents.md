## Installed Specialists

- **backend-developer**: Senior backend engineer specializing in scalable API development and microservices architecture. Builds robust server-side solutions with focus on performance, security, and maintainability.
- **code-migration-specialist**: Use this agent when you need to migrate existing code to a new architecture, framework, or language while preserving exact functionality and logic. This includes platform migrations (e.g., monolith to microservices), language translations (e.g., Python to TypeScript), framework upgrades (e.g., Angular to React), or architectural refactors. Examples: 1) User: 'I need to migrate this Express.js API to FastAPI' → Assistant: 'I'll use the code-migration-specialist agent to analyze the Express.js codebase and create an equivalent FastAPI implementation.' 2) User: 'Please convert this class-based React component to functional components with hooks' → Assistant: 'Let me engage the code-migration-specialist agent to perform this migration while maintaining all existing behavior.' 3) User: 'We're moving from REST to GraphQL, help migrate these endpoints' → Assistant: 'I'll use the code-migration-specialist agent to map the REST logic to GraphQL resolvers.'
- **code-reviewer**: Expert code reviewer specializing in code quality, security vulnerabilities, and best practices across multiple languages. Masters static analysis, design patterns, and performance optimization with focus on maintainability and technical debt reduction.
- **documentation-engineer**: Expert documentation engineer specializing in technical documentation systems, API documentation, and developer-friendly content. Masters documentation-as-code, automated generation, and creating maintainable documentation that developers actually use.
- **patent-engineer**: Use this agent when working on any intellectual property or patent-related tasks. This includes drafting patent applications, writing or analyzing claims, conducting prior art searches and analysis, responding to USPTO office actions, evaluating freedom-to-operate concerns, developing patent filing strategies, or reviewing invention disclosures. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: The user has described a new invention and needs help protecting it.\nuser: "I've invented a new type of battery cooling system that uses phase-change materials embedded in a honeycomb structure. How should I patent this?"\nassistant: "This sounds like a promising invention with multiple patentable aspects. Let me use the patent-engineer agent to analyze your invention and develop a comprehensive patent strategy."\n<commentary>\nSince the user is asking about patenting a new invention, use the Task tool to launch the patent-engineer agent to provide strategic guidance on claim drafting, prior art considerations, and filing approaches.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: The user has received an office action rejection from the USPTO.\nuser: "I got a 103 obviousness rejection combining two references. The examiner says my claim 1 is obvious over Smith in view of Jones. What should I do?"\nassistant: "Office action responses require careful analysis of the cited references and strategic claim amendments. Let me engage the patent-engineer agent to help craft a response."\n<commentary>\nSince the user needs help responding to a patent office action with obviousness rejections, use the patent-engineer agent to analyze the rejection, identify distinguishing features, and draft arguments or amendments.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: The user is writing code for a product and mentions patent concerns.\nuser: "Before I implement this algorithm, I'm worried it might infringe on existing patents. Can you check?"\nassistant: "Freedom-to-operate analysis is critical before product development. Let me use the patent-engineer agent to help assess potential infringement risks."\n<commentary>\nSince the user is concerned about potential patent infringement, proactively engage the patent-engineer agent to conduct an FTO analysis and identify any blocking patents or design-around opportunities.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: The user needs help drafting patent claims.\nuser: "I need to write claims for a machine learning model that predicts equipment failures using sensor data and historical maintenance records."\nassistant: "Patent claims for ML/AI inventions require careful drafting to ensure subject matter eligibility and proper scope. Let me engage the patent-engineer agent to draft comprehensive claims."\n<commentary>\nSince the user needs patent claims drafted, use the patent-engineer agent to create properly formatted independent and dependent claims covering method, system, and apparatus aspects while addressing 35 USC 101 concerns.\n</commentary>\n</example>
- **principal-engineer**: Use this agent when you need to implement production-ready code that follows enterprise-level best practices and architectural standards. Specifically:\n\n- When building new features or systems that require careful planning and scalable architecture\n- When refactoring existing code to meet production standards\n- When you need code that handles edge cases, errors, and observability\n- When implementing critical business logic that requires robust testing\n- When architectural decisions need to be documented and justified\n\nExamples:\n\nuser: "I need to build a user authentication system"\nassistant: "I'm going to use the principal-engineer agent to plan and implement a production-ready authentication system with proper security controls and error handling."\n\nuser: "This payment processing function needs to be production-ready"\nassistant: "Let me engage the principal-engineer agent to refactor this code with proper error handling, logging, idempotency, and comprehensive tests."\n\nuser: "We need an API endpoint for managing user profiles"\nassistant: "I'll use the principal-engineer agent to design and implement this endpoint following REST best practices, with validation, error handling, and proper documentation."
- **qa-expert**: Expert QA engineer specializing in comprehensive quality assurance, test strategy, and quality metrics. Masters manual and automated testing, test planning, and quality processes with focus on delivering high-quality software through systematic testing.
