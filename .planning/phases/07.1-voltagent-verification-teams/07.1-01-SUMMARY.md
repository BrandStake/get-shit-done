# Phase 07.1 Plan 01: Core Verification Infrastructure Summary

**Completed:** 2026-02-23
**Duration:** 8 minutes

## What Was Built

Implemented core verification infrastructure in the execute-phase orchestrator that enables quality gates through specialist verification after task completion. The system uses tiered verification (1-3) based on task characteristics, spawning appropriate specialists (code-reviewer, qa-expert, principal-engineer) with focused context for validation.

## Key Decisions

1. **Tiered Verification System**: Implemented 3-tier system matching task risk to verification depth
2. **Keyword-Based Detection**: Automatic tier assignment based on security/API/simple change keywords
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Verification skipped if specialists unavailable rather than blocking execution
4. **Context Brief Generation**: Dynamic verification brief created with tier-specific focus areas
5. **Override Capability**: Tasks can specify explicit verification_tier attribute to control verification

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `/Users/matte/Documents/workspace/get-shit-done/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs` - Added determine-verification-tier command
- `/Users/matte/Documents/workspace/get-shit-done/get-shit-done/bin/lib/agents.cjs` - Verification tier logic with keyword detection
- `/Users/matte/Documents/workspace/get-shit-done/get-shit-done/workflows/execute-phase.md` - Verification spawning after task completion
- `/Users/matte/Documents/workspace/get-shit-done/agents/gsd-planner.md` - Documentation of verification_tier task attribute

### Key Components

**Verification Tier Detection**:
- Tier 3: Security, auth, payment, database operations
- Tier 2: API, business logic, integration work
- Tier 1: Simple changes and documentation
- Tier 0: Skip verification (explicit opt-out)

**Specialist Assignment**:
- Tier 1: code-reviewer only
- Tier 2: code-reviewer + qa-expert
- Tier 3: Full team (code-reviewer, qa-expert, principal-engineer)

**Context Generation**:
- Verification brief with task details, tier, and focus areas
- Task success criteria extracted from plan
- Modified files list for targeted review

## Technical Outcomes

### Capabilities Delivered
- `determine-verification-tier` command for tier classification
- Specialist spawning logic in execute-phase orchestrator
- Verification brief generation for focused reviews
- Result parsing and decision logic (PASS/FAIL/WARNING)
- Verification logging to SUMMARY.md for audit trail

### Integration Points
- Execute-phase orchestrator calls gsd-tools for tier determination
- Task tool spawns verification specialists with context
- SUMMARY.md records verification results
- Config-based enablement for optional verification

## Verification Status

All success criteria met:
- ✓ Verification tier determination working
- ✓ Code-reviewer spawning after task completion
- ✓ Verification results parsed and decisions made
- ✓ Failed verifications block task progression
- ✓ Verification results logged to SUMMARY.md
- ✓ verification_tier field documented in planner

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Next Phase Readiness

Phase 07.1-02 can proceed to implement:
- Multi-specialist teams for Tier 2/3 verification
- Sequential vs parallel verification modes
- Aggregation logic for multiple specialist findings
- Configuration options in .planning/config.json

## Performance Notes

- Task 1: Verification tier detection - 2 min
- Task 2: Verification spawning logic - 2 min
- Task 3: Context generation - 2 min
- Task 4: Documentation updates - 2 min

Total execution time: 8 minutes (well within 15-60 min target)
