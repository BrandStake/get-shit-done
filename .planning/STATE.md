## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Subagents lack Task tool access (v1.21 post-mortem) — Only orchestrators can spawn agents
- Planner assigns specialists to tasks — Routing decision at planning time, not execution
- Orchestrator spawns specialists — Read PLAN.md, spawn appropriate specialist, pass results back
- Available agents list via context files — Orchestrator generates available_agents.md for planner
