# Phase 07.1 Plan 02: Multi-Specialist Verification Teams Summary

**Completed:** 2026-02-23
**Duration:** 7 minutes

## What Was Built

Implemented multi-specialist verification teams that spawn multiple specialists based on verification tier, with configuration-driven behavior and override capabilities. Tier 2 tasks now spawn both code-reviewer and qa-expert, while Tier 3 tasks run a full sequential verification chain with all three specialists.

## Key Decisions

1. **Tier-Based Specialist Lists**: Generate appropriate specialist lists based on verification tier (1=code-reviewer, 2=+qa-expert, 3=+principal-engineer)
2. **Multi-Specialist Spawning Loop**: Process all available specialists with specialist-specific focus areas
3. **Result Aggregation**: Combine findings from multiple specialists with FAIL taking precedence
4. **Configuration-Driven Behavior**: Full verification configuration in config.json with multiple override mechanisms
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Skip verification when required specialists unavailable rather than blocking

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `/Users/matte/Documents/workspace/get-shit-done/get-shit-done/workflows/execute-phase.md` - Multi-specialist spawning and aggregation
- `/Users/matte/Documents/workspace/get-shit-done/.planning/config.json` - Verification configuration section
- `/Users/matte/Documents/workspace/get-shit-done/get-shit-done/docs/VERIFICATION.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### Key Components

**Multi-Specialist Spawning**:
- Loop through all available specialists for tier
- Create specialist-specific context with focus areas
- Pass previous findings to next specialist (Tier 3)
- Early stop on failure for Tier 3 sequential chains

**Configuration Support**:
- Master enable/disable switch
- Default tier and tier overrides by keyword
- Required vs optional specialist lists
- Fail on missing required specialists option
- Sequential vs parallel execution modes

**Result Aggregation**:
- Collect issues and suggestions from all specialists
- Overall FAIL if any specialist fails
- User decision prompts on failure (fix/continue/skip)
- Aggregated findings logged to SUMMARY.md

## Technical Outcomes

### Capabilities Delivered
- Multi-specialist verification teams for Tier 2 and 3
- Configuration-driven verification with overrides
- Aggregated result handling and decision logic
- Comprehensive documentation with examples
- Graceful degradation for missing specialists

### Integration Points
- Execute-phase reads verification config from config.json
- Tier overrides based on task keywords (authentication, payments, database)
- Environment variable override (SKIP_VERIFICATION)
- Task-level override via verification_tier attribute
- Required specialist checking with configurable failure mode

## Verification Status

All success criteria met:
- ✓ Tier 2 tasks spawn both code-reviewer and qa-expert
- ✓ Tier 3 tasks run sequential verification chain
- ✓ Verification can be disabled via config
- ✓ Multiple specialist results are aggregated correctly
- ✓ Config reading is properly integrated in execute-phase.md
- ✓ VERIFICATION.md provides clear usage patterns (243 lines)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Next Phase Readiness

Phase 07.1 verification infrastructure is now complete. The system supports:
- Single and multi-specialist verification
- Tiered verification based on task risk
- Configuration-driven behavior with overrides
- Graceful degradation for missing specialists
- Comprehensive documentation for users

Ready to proceed with Phase 08 for orchestrator spawning improvements or continue with additional verification enhancements.

## Performance Notes

- Task 1: Tier-based specialist lists - 1 min
- Task 2: Multi-specialist spawning loop - 1 min
- Task 3: Result aggregation logic - 1 min
- Task 4: Configuration support - 1 min
- Task 5: Config wiring - 2 min
- Task 6: Documentation - 1 min

Total execution time: 7 minutes (well within 15-60 min target)
