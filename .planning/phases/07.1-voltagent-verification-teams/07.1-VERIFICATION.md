### Anti-Patterns Found

No blocker or warning anti-patterns found. The implementation is complete and production-ready:

- No TODO/FIXME comments indicating incomplete work
- No placeholder content or empty implementations
- No console.log-only handlers
- All functions have real logic
- All key links are wired correctly

### Functional Tests Performed

Verified the determine-verification-tier command works correctly:

```bash
# Test 1: Tier 3 detection for authentication
$ node gsd-tools.cjs determine-verification-tier "Add user authentication" "src/auth/login.ts" --raw
Result: {"tier": 3, "reason": "Critical path detected: auth", "specialists": ["code-reviewer", "qa-expert", "principal-engineer"]}
✓ PASS

# Test 2: Tier 1 detection for documentation
$ node gsd-tools.cjs determine-verification-tier "Update documentation" "docs/README.md" --raw
Result: {"tier": 1, "reason": "Simple change - light review", "specialists": ["code-reviewer"]}
✓ PASS
```
