# Phase 6.2: VoltAgent Verification Teams - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Orchestrate parallel review specialists (code-reviewer, security-auditor, architect-reviewer) alongside gsd-verifier to provide comprehensive phase verification. Use Task tool to spawn reviewers in parallel, aggregate findings into unified VERIFICATION.md with severity-based organization.

## Implementation Decisions

### Reviewer team composition
- Contextual selection based on what changed (not always all 4 reviewers)
- Code changes: include code-reviewer, security-auditor, architect-reviewer, gsd-verifier
- Docs-only changes: gsd-verifier only (solo verification)
- security-auditor: include for any code changes (let it decide relevance)
- architect-reviewer: include for any code changes (let it decide relevance)

### Aggregation strategy
- Findings organized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- 4 severity levels for granular prioritization
- Deduplicate overlapping findings, note all sources ("Found by: code-reviewer, security-auditor")
- gsd-verifier makes final call on severity conflicts between reviewers

### Verification scope
- Triggered for code phases only (skip docs-only/config-only phases)
- Phase-level verification (one verification after all plans complete)
- Reviewers analyze: modified files + their direct dependencies (imports/callers)
- Hard limit of 50 files per review; chunk into multiple reviews if exceeded

### Failure handling
- Retry once on reviewer timeout/failure, then continue with available results
- If specialist reviewers fail after retry: proceed without them, note in report
- If gsd-verifier fails: fallback to basic built-in checks (solo verifier mode)
- 10-minute timeout per reviewer
- When specialists unavailable (not installed): prompt user to install before proceeding

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact chunking strategy for >50 files
- How to identify "direct dependencies" for different languages
- Format of "Found by" attribution in deduplicated findings
- How to detect docs-only vs code phases

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Severity levels: Critical (blocks release), High (should fix before merge), Medium (fix soon), Low (nice to have)
- The goal is actionable findings that feed directly into gap-closure planning
- Multiple reviewers flagging same issue = higher confidence, worth noting

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
